2. Explain when a database would be used. Explain when a text file would be used.

A: Databases are used to store and manage data. They are a way to make it easy to store and search for specific data and handle multiple applications that need access to that data. A text file could be used for small and simple databases. Copying data within a text file is slow and prone to errors, so as long as the file is small and simple, you can use a text file.

3. Describe one difference between SQL and other programming languages.

A: The biggest difference between SQL and other programming languages is the syntax. You only need to be concerned with the data that you are trying to retrieve rather than the procedure for how it is being retrieved or stored. It is declarative instead of procedural.

4. In your own words, explain how the pieces of a database system fit together at a high level.

A: A database system is made up of the table that stores the data in binary file format, and the interface such as a GUI or an application that is used to store and access the data that is in the database.

5. Explain the meaning of table, row, column, and value.

A: Databases use a table format with columns, rows, and cells. Each column represents the information type or what the information in that column represents. The rows are kind of like a data object. They represent data that is associated with one thing or object, and the data in each row falls under a column that labels the type of information. The cells are the intersection of the colums and rows. The value is simply the quantitative value that is represented in the cell.

6. List three data types that can be used in a table.

A: The three data types that can be used in tables are numbers, to include integers and floating point numbers, strings, and objects.

   WHERE email = 'aleesia.algorithm@uw.edu'

   Output: 1

All the columns for the user ID equal to 4.

A: SELECT *
   FROM users
   WHERE userid = 4

   Output: Brandy Boolean bboolean@nasa.gov 1999-10-15
